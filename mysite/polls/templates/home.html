    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p> I'm an advocate of impact investing, triple-bottom-line business, and entrepreneurship more generally.</p>
    <p> For 3 years I worked as a consultant providing quantitative and qualitative analysis on climate and energy policy and the carbon market. </p>
    <p> I've always been interested in clothing and textiles and in 2011 I started programming and cofounded <a href="http://www.clothesliner.com/demonstration">Clothesliner</a>, a website that described the fit of clothing by comparing any item to something you're familiar with. </p>
    <p> I'm currently an independent consultant working in the carbon market and always looking to meet other entrepreneurs, social or otherwise. Email me at ptrklly (at gmail). </p>
